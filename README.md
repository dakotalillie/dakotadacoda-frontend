# DakotaDacoda Frontend

This is the frontend code for my personal website, built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Features

* Styled with SCSS and Bootstrap via [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/).
* Tested with Jest and Enzyme. A good example of behavior-driven testing can be found with the [Contact component](https://github.com/dakotalillie/dakotadacoda-frontend/blob/master/src/components/welcome/contact/Contact.test.jsx).
* The contact form backend is currently handled via [Formspree](https://formspree.io/), though I eventually intend to replace this with my own service.
* Icons are from [React-Fontawesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome) and [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).
* Spinner is from [React-Loader-Spinner](https://github.com/mhnpd/react-loader-spinner).
* NavLink scroll functionality handled by [React-Scroll-To-Component](https://github.com/flyingant/react-scroll-to-component).
