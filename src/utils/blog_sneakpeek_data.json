    "Recently I’ve been building an app using a combination of React for the frontend and Django for the backend. I wasn’t previously all too familiar with Django, but this seemed like a good opportunity to teach myself, and having experience with Ruby on Rails has made the process a little easier. However, Django and Rails have their fair share of differences, and one of the things which I’ve had the most trouble implementing is user authentication. So I’m sharing what I’ve learned, in the hopes that you too might find it useful!",
